# tailwind-layout-react

‚ö†Ô∏è I don't think it is a good idea to transfrom tailwindcss to react layout component. And it is not easy to do this. There are some reasons.

- Tailwindcss don't support string template, some like `text-${color}-600`, so it is difficult to transform all props' value.
- Hover and focus states are not a good idea in React JSX or TSX.

So the project will be put on hold. I'm so sorry.

~~The project is under urgent development. Please don't use it in  production environment.~~

Use React to layout easier with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).
